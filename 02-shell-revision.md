## Morning 2 shell revision

1. **C**hange **D**irectory back to your work folder on the Bowen drive  (`/{letter}/work/{COHORT}/{IDENT}/`)  

2. And then into `content/week01/shell-intro/north-pacific-gyre/`  

3. **L**i**s**t the files in this directory  

4. **M**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory named `z_samples`  

5. Using wildcards, copy the files with a ‘Z’ in the name into `z_samples`  

6. Use ‘**head**’ to peek at the contents of the files you’ve copied into `z_samples`  

7. The files in `z_samples` contain a list of numbers. Use piped commands to list the 5 largest 
  numbers they contain, combined  

8. Repeat 7., but direct the result into a file 5_largest_z_samples.txt  

9. Write a FOR loop to print just the smallest number in each sample file  

10. Advanced challenge:  Write a FOR loop that would, in turn, print the 2nd, 5th, and 9th line 
  of NENE01971Z.txt
